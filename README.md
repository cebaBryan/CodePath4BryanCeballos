## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- When trying to do the camera feature, an issue i ran into is that since we were working through a simulator, it would be difficult to show the camera since it relies on the system's capabilities. The conclusion i came to while,working was that as long as we dont simulate the app on an actual app and not a simulator, the camera option cannot be used/optimized.
